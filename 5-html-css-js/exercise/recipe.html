    <h1>Katie's Louisiana-Style Spaghetti</h1>
    <p>There wasn't a woman on the Mississippi river that could cook like my late Granny,
    Katie Lee. She was known all over our hometown and the cities over for being a good meal
    you could count on. My favorite was her spaghetti. It was spicy with  a little sweetness but
    a ton of savory. Since her passing, I've made it my mission to recreate her recipes. I hope
    you all enjoy! <3</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <li>Tony Cachere's Seasoning<li>
        <li>Black Pepper</li>
        <li>White Sugar</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic </li>
        <li>Diced Celery</li>
        <li>Diced yellow onion</li>
        <li>Diced green bell peppers</li>
        <li>29oz of Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>29oz of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2lbs of ground meat - beef or turkey</li>
        <li>2lbs of smoked andouille sausage</li>
        <li>2lbs of thin spaghetti noodles</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by boiling your pasta</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, brown your ground meat. Add diced vegetables and minced garlic halfway
            through.</li>
        <li>Add your spices. I recommend heavily seasoning as we will not be seasoning the sauce itself.
            Do NOT add the sugar.</li>
        <li>Add sliced sausages and crushed tomatoes to ground meat. You'll let this simmer for
            8-10 minutes. You want to give your base the chance to release the flavors and aromas
            of the previously added ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>Add your tomato sauce. Allow sauce to come back to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Mix your drained spaghetti noodles wit your meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a thin layer of sugar over the top and mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>-Most importantly, ENJOY!</li>
    </ol>

Looking for your next murder mystery fix? You've landed in the right place! When your usual puzzles, riddles,
and games just aren't satisfying that itch, our murder mysteries are sure to leave you satisfied. I would've said
'happy' but that would  probably make us a little weird, huh? The mystery is designed to be solved in 5 minutes or
less, but there's no shame in taking longer. We love a thorough investigation! Come back tomorrow to find out if
you're the next Sherlock Holmes or another Officer Doofy. Good Luck!
<h2>Did you get it right? Yesterday's solution:</h2>
The Butler in the Kitchen with the Candelabra.
